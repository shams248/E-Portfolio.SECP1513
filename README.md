**_Reflection:_** üíÅüèª

Through various industry talks and visits, I gained valuable skills in filtering information and systematically organizing useful content into posters, newsletters, and reports to enhance visual impact and readability. Designing these materials has been challenging, as I do not have a formal background in design. To overcome this, I studied examples from professional design websites and resources, which helped me achieve satisfactory results. This experience underscored the importance of learning from others to compensate for my own limitations and improve my work.

**_Reflection:_** ‚úäüèª
This course highlighted the significance of integrity in various areas of life, showing that every action, whether good or bad, carries its own consequences. The overarching message is that the effort we put into our actions ultimately shapes the outcomes we experience.

It would be beneficial to have more in-person sessions, as they can enhance our connection with the lecturer, offering clarity that might be harder to achieve through online communication alone.

4. Final Project: Data Transmission___

**_Reflection:_** üíÅ

The Digital Logic course provided hands-on experience through a series of labs and a final project. Lab 1 focused on basic gate circuit simulations using DEEDS, reinforcing foundational concepts of logic gates. Lab 2 involved designing and simulating combinational circuits like multiplexers and decoders, enhancing my skills in circuit optimization and debugging. Lab 3 introduced sequential circuits through a bi-directional counter design, deepening my understanding of flip-flops and timing. The final project on data transmission integrated these concepts into a functional system, solidifying my knowledge in digital logic design and application.

üßÆ **_Discrete Structure_** 

Assignment 1: [Chapter 1.1 to 2.2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0OBIHcTXT22i2JfuXLuhohWBG5tHSMf/view?usp=sharing)

Assignment 2: [Chapter 2.3 to 3.4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1he5P8jtNqL2nB06v3tTD5rqnCmoHhB9R/view?usp=sharing)

Assignment 3: [Chapter 3.5 to 4.3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/191vh6R2DFQvN-ZOlwgMh0X_kcMuEw3gm/view?usp=sharing)

Assignment 4: [Chapter 4.7 to 5.2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18eNV90a4B9LH8pjXHPYJEaDEkcpDN9hQ/view?usp=sharing)

**_Reflection:_** üíÅüèª

These Discrete Structure assignments taught me the importance of thoroughly reviewing work before submission. Initially, we tended to rely on luck and checked our answers superficially, which led to multiple careless mistakes in Assignment 1 (covering Chapters 1.1 to 2.2). Since resubmissions were not allowed, this experience emphasized the need for complete focus and attention to detail in every task. Additionally, these assignments and the course itself deepened my understanding of permutations, combinations, and probability, while also enhancing my logical thinking and analytical skills. 
One area for improvement in the course is the inclusion of more challenging questions. The majority of tasks provided were basic or moderately difficult, but incorporating trickier problems would push us to think more critically about the logic behind mathematical calculations, leading to greater skill development and higher standards.

**_Reflection:_** ‚úåüèª

Programming Technique 1 has been the most demanding course for me, focusing heavily on practical skills rather than just theoretical understanding. Despite grasping the revision materials, I often found myself relying on online resources to solve complex problems. The final assignment emphasized that coding a comprehensive project involves integrating various elements like input/output, functions, and arrays. This realization made me aware that I need to invest more effort in honing my coding skills to stay competitive in the IT industry. I believe more discussions on large project coding would help us understand key techniques and how to tackle complex tasks more effectively.
