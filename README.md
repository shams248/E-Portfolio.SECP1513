üñ•Ô∏è **_Technology & Information System_**
1. <ins>Industry Talk and Industry Visit<ins>

   From all the assignments of related to industry talk and visit, I learned the way to filter information and arrange all the useful information inside a poster/newsletter/report systematically to create a stronger visual impact and easier-to-understand
   content. Designing a report, poster and newsletter are challenging for me since I'm not a student that learn design from a profession before. Due to this problem, I used Pinterest to search some examples as inspiration and I'm satisfied with the outcomes. 
   From this, I learned that how important it is to learn from others to make up for my own shortcomings.

2. <ins>Design Thinking: MedLink System Integrated APP</ins>

   This is the first big project that related to technology I conducted with my group members. This project forces me to trigger my creativity to produce an attractive idea to be adopted. Before coming up with an actual 
   plan for my idea, I did a lot of research to ensure that the idea can be implemented in reality, but not just by imagination. I have to confirm that it is a thing that has a market in Malaysia, and people really need 
   it to solve their daily life problems. An understanding of the big issue faced by people is the key point to make this a successful project. During the process of this project, we met a lot of difficulties. Once a 
   problem is solved, another will appear. This alerts me to how important it is to think about everything thoroughly. It is very important to have an efficient discussion among all the group members to do such a big 
   project in a group. When there are more than 2 people in a gourp, there will be a lot of ideas with different sights, to reach an agreement is the first challenge we face. In our group, everyone has a chance to 
   persuade the others, we have to show the advantages and disadvantages of our ideas. Even though we had a small conflict in between reaching an agreement, we resolved it pretty well by voting fairly.

**<ins>In Summary</ins>**
 
As I mentioned above, I learned a lot from this course. For example, the way to filter information, hands-one ability, effective discussion with group members, and knowledge absorption on the spot. Every assignments 
or projects of this course are vary. The tasks we have to face are different as well and it is very interesting in exploring various fields. It is a fun course because it allows us to experience lots of different 
stuffs like the PC Assemble Lab, poster designing, and idea generation. During this course, we have lots of chance to interact with the international students, since basically we have in-class activities every weeks 
in group.

If there is any improvement that I have to suggest, it will only be more theoretical lessons are needed. Due to the in-class activities that may take the whole class' hours, our class is lacks of theoretical lesson.
A balance between theoretical lessons and in-class activities need to be maintain. 

üßÆ **_Discrete Structure_**

   Assignments of Discrete Structure taught me that before submitting any assignments or projects, we must check it at least 3 times with eyes open widely. Due to the mentality of luck, we just check our answers roughly 
   and our Assignment 1 (Chapter 1.1 to 2.2) turns out that we have more than a careless mistake. However, the submission is due, no more edit and re-submission are allowed. This had give me a lesson that wishful 
   thinking has to be avoided and we have to pay 100% of concentration in doing everything. Other than that, these assignments and discrete structure course help me to have a deeper understanding towards permutation, 
   combination, and probability. Also they help me to improve my logical thinking skills and analysis skills on questions or difficulties. The main thing I gained from this course is that it is important to do self- 
   improvement or self-learning to have a better understanding.

   Improvement that can be done of this course is that there is too little of tricky questions provided for us to try. Most of the tasks given in class or through e-learning are mostly basic or average hard level. Tricky 
   questions are one of the tool that can force us to think about the logic behind every mathematic calculation or the answers. If we only do basic questions or questions with moderate hard level, we can't get any 
   improvement. Hence, our standard can't be elevated. 
 
üí° **_Digital Logic_**

Through this course I learned how the microprocessors of computer works and the basic logic behind coding. The lab I mentioned above taught me how logic gates can be connected in such a way we can get desirce result. It provides me a hands-on chance to do the connection of logic gates by my teammates and me under the care of insturctors and professor. I have a deeper understanding on how binary number works in computer.

I suggest that more exercises should be provided through e-learning platform for us to do since exercises make perfect. We need more exercises to be more familiar with it. If not it's too easy for me to be forgetful about the knowledges I gained from lecturer during the classes.

‚å®Ô∏è **_Programming Technique 1_**

Programming Technique 1 could be said is the most challenging course among the 5 courses. It's more about practical than theoretical knowledge. Even though I understood everything in the teaching materials provided by lecturer for revision, it doesn't mean that I can completely done a big question without the help of online sources. For the last assignment we done is very complex, it alert me that a thorough coding for a project is the combination of everything we learned, like input and output, function, and array. I knew that I have to pay more effort on this course and coding to be a valuable and competitive person in the Information Technology industry. 

For the suggestion, I hope that more discussion about coding of a big project could be done so that we will know what should be notice and the technics we need to solve a complicated task. 

üñãÔ∏è **_Integrity and Anti-corruption_**

This course taught me how to be an integrity person in the community, university, and family. If I want to conclude all the knowledges and values I gained from this course with a sentence it will be "You are rewarded for your efforts." You did crime, you are rewarded by legal punishment; you did good deeds, you gain good karma. 

One of the suggestions from me is that more physical classes should be held so that we can connect with the lecturer much more easier because we might not get the respond through online communication due to the busyness of lecturer.
